# Pasta Carbonara

A classic Italian pasta dish with eggs, cheese, and pancetta.

## Ingredients

- 1 lb spaghetti
- 4 large eggs
- 1 cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 8 oz pancetta, diced
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- Salt and black pepper to taste
- Fresh parsley for garnish

## Instructions

1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti according to package directions until al dente.

2. While pasta cooks, fry pancetta in a large skillet over medium heat until crispy, about 8 minutes. Add garlic and cook for 1 minute.

3. In a bowl, whisk together eggs and Parmesan cheese. Season with black pepper.

4. Drain pasta, reserving 1 cup pasta water. Add hot pasta to the skillet with pancetta.

5. Remove from heat. Quickly stir in egg mixture, tossing constantly. Add pasta water as needed to create a creamy sauce.

6. Serve immediately, garnished with parsley and extra Parmesan.

## Tips

- Use fresh, high-quality eggs for the best flavor
- The residual heat cooks the eggs, so remove from heat before adding them
- Don't add the eggs over direct heat or they will scramble
